def two_peaks_threshold(image, smooth_hist=True, sigma=5):
    """Runs the two peaks threshold algorithm. It selects two peaks
    from the histogram and return the index of the minimum value
    between them.

    The first peak is deemed to be the maximum value fo the histogram,
    while the algorithm will look for the second peak by multiplying the
    histogram values by the square of the distance from the first peak.
    This gives preference to peaks that are not close to the maximum.
